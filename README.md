## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexyvanot/Snake-Game-AI.git
    cd Snake-Game-AI
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main script to start the Snake Game AI:
   ```bash
    python main.py
   ```
